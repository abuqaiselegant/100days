        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will learn some details of OOP in Python and put your knowledge into practice by developing and testing two classes: `Person` and `Database`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Exercise 1\n",
        "\n",
        "Create class `Person` to store information about a person.  Include the following attributes:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   First name\n",
        "*   Last name\n",
        "*   Year of birth (e.g., 1990)\n",
        "*   Parent 1 (an object of class `Person`)\n",
        "*   Parent 2 (an object of class `Person`)\n",
        "\n",
        "_Note that Parent 1 and Parent 2 are not strings!_\n",
        "\n",
        "Refer to the lecture code for an example of how to create a class and store data in its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "An interesting detail about this example is the recursion within class `Person`; two attributes of class `Person` person are of type `Person`.  We will talk about the mechanisc of this in the coming lectures.  In the meantime, you may face a dilemma; when creating an object of class `Person`, you may not always want to specify the parents.  You will need to find a way to keep this flexible: specify the parents when you need but also allow skipping one or both of them.  There exist many reasonable approaches to this problem; you can use any of them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your implementation of `Person` should also include several methods:\n",
        "*   Constructor `__init__` that initialises the object.\n",
        "*   `__str__` function.  This is a standard function that takes no parameters (only `self`) and returns a string representation of the object.  Every time you call the `str` function in Python, Python actually calls the `__str__` function of the object that is being converted into a string.  In this exercise, you will probably want to return the full name of the person, although you may also include some other infromation.\n",
        "*   `get_full_name` that returns the full name of the person.\n",
        "*   `get_age` that calculates the current age of the person.  Your implementation should check the current year (Google how to do this) and subtract the year of birth.\n",
        "*   `get_parents` that returns the list of known parents (it can be empty, or contain one or two elements).  Note that this should be a list of objects of class `Parent`, not their names.\n",
        "\n",
        "Write your code below.  In this and the following exercises, you will need to determinte the most appropriate parameter lists for each method.\n",
